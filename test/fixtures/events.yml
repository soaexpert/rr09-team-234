    label: ThrillerLane
    name: Thriller in The Lane 
    description: An exciting flashmob event being held in honour of what would have been Michael Jackson’s 51st birthday, on Saturday 29th August 09. is being called ‘Thriller in the Lane’ as it will be held in the Cafe Quarter of Cardiff on Mill Lane.  All you need to do is go to the Mill Lane and join in as they take to the street for a dance to this classic record at 9pm.  there will be a PA on hand to strike up the tune for everyone to dance to.  Obviously people going the whole hog and donning the full zombie garb will stand out from the rest and Thriller dance ‘experts’ can join in and lead the way. The flashmob thriller dance uses the slightly easier dance move lessons that can be found on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DaFu2dednmY&feature=related and the group of You Tube stars who re-created the dance at a friends hen party in Cardiff, and have confirmed that their party will be attending at Thriller in the Lane. ”
